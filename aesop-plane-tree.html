		Two Travellers, walking in the noonday sun, sought the shade of a widespreading tree to rest. As they lay looking up among the pleasant leaves, they saw that it was a Plane Tree.
		<br>
   <br>
   "How useless is the Plane!" said one of them. "It bears no fruit whatever, and only serves to litter the ground with leaves."
   <br><br>
   "Ungrateful creatures!" said a voice from the Plane Tree. "You lie here in my cooling shade, and yet you say I am useless! Thus ungratefully, O Jupiter, do men receive their blessings!"
